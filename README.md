# Inventory Optimization System

End-to-end demand forecasting and inventory optimization system with financial impact quantification.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Develop a production-ready system that predicts product demand and optimizes inventory levels to minimize costs while maintaining high service levels. This project demonstrates advanced data science, optimization, and business analytics skills applicable to enterprise supply chain management.

## 📊 Business Problem

Retailers face the challenge of balancing inventory costs against service level requirements. Holding excess inventory ties up capital and incurs storage costs, while insufficient inventory leads to stockouts and lost sales. This project develops a data-driven approach to optimize this trade-off.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Forecasting**: statsmodels, prophet, scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Optimization**: PuLP
- **Development**: Jupyter, Git
